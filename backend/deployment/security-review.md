# Security Review - Dyad CLI Gateway Production Deployment

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented for the production deployment of the Dyad CLI Gateway, focusing on container security, network isolation, and secure sandbox execution.

## Security Architecture

### 1. Container Security

#### Base Image Security
- **Minimal Base Images**: Using Alpine Linux (node:18-alpine) for reduced attack surface
- **Non-root Execution**: All containers run as non-root users (UID 1001)
- **Read-only Root Filesystem**: Containers use read-only root filesystems where possible
- **Capability Dropping**: All unnecessary Linux capabilities are dropped
- **Security Context**: Comprehensive security contexts applied to all pods

#### Image Scanning
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Container images scanned for known vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Auditing**: Regular npm audit for Node.js dependencies
- **Base Image Updates**: Automated updates for base images and security patches

### 2. Kubernetes Security

#### Pod Security Standards
- **Restricted Profile**: Enforcing Kubernetes Pod Security Standards (restricted)
- **Security Contexts**: Comprehensive security contexts on all pods
- **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory limits to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Network Policies**: Strict network segmentation between components

#### RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- **Minimal Permissions**: Service accounts with minimal required permissions
- **Namespace Isolation**: Separate namespaces for gateway and sandbox execution
- **API Access Control**: Limited Kubernetes API access for sandbox management only

#### Secrets Management
- **Kubernetes Secrets**: Sensitive data stored in Kubernetes secrets
- **Encryption at Rest**: Cluster-level encryption for etcd
- **Secret Rotation**: Documented procedures for credential rotation
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All secrets externalized from application code

### 3. Sandbox Security

#### Kubernetes Jobs vs Docker Socket
- **No Docker Socket**: Eliminated Docker socket mounting vulnerability
- **Kubernetes Jobs**: Isolated job execution in separate namespace
- **Resource Limits**: Strict CPU, memory, and storage limits on sandbox jobs
- **Network Isolation**: Network policies preventing sandbox internet access
- **Automatic Cleanup**: TTL-based cleanup of completed jobs

#### gVisor Integration (Optional)
- **User-space Kernel**: Additional isolation layer with gVisor runtime
- **Syscall Filtering**: Reduced kernel attack surface
- **Container Breakout Protection**: Enhanced protection against container escapes

### 4. Network Security

#### Network Segmentation
- **Network Policies**: Kubernetes NetworkPolicies for micro-segmentation
- **Ingress Control**: Controlled ingress through NGINX ingress controller
- **TLS Termination**: HTTPS/TLS for all external communications
- **Internal Communication**: Encrypted communication between services

#### API Security
- **Authentication**: API key-based authentication for gateway endpoints
- **Authorization**: Role-based authorization for admin endpoints
- **Rate Limiting**: Request rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization

### 5. Monitoring and Auditing

#### Security Monitoring
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Security-related metrics collection
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails for all actions
- **Alerting**: Security alerts for suspicious activities
- **Log Analysis**: Centralized logging with security event correlation

#### Compliance
- **Security Scanning**: Regular security scans and assessments
- **Vulnerability Management**: Process for handling security vulnerabilities
- **Incident Response**: Documented incident response procedures

## Security Checklist

### Pre-deployment
- [ ] Container images scanned and approved
- [ ] Secrets properly configured and encrypted
- [ ] Network policies tested and validated
- [ ] RBAC permissions reviewed and minimized
- [ ] Security contexts applied to all pods
- [ ] Resource limits configured appropriately

### Post-deployment
- [ ] Security monitoring enabled and alerting configured
- [ ] Audit logging verified and centralized
- [ ] Network segmentation tested
- [ ] Sandbox isolation verified
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested
- [ ] Incident response procedures documented

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk (Mitigated)
1. **Container Breakout**: Mitigated by gVisor, security contexts, and capability dropping
2. **Privilege Escalation**: Mitigated by non-root execution and RBAC
3. **Network Attacks**: Mitigated by network policies and TLS encryption
4. **Resource Exhaustion**: Mitigated by resource limits and quotas

### Medium Risk (Monitored)
1. **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Monitored through automated scanning
2. **Configuration Drift**: Monitored through GitOps and configuration management
3. **Insider Threats**: Mitigated through audit logging and access controls

### Low Risk (Accepted)
1. **Physical Access**: Assumed cloud provider handles physical security
2. **Supply Chain**: Mitigated through image scanning and trusted registries

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Enable Pod Security Standards in all namespaces
2. Implement comprehensive network policies
3. Configure security monitoring and alerting
4. Establish secret rotation procedures

### Future Enhancements
1. Implement service mesh (Istio) for enhanced security
2. Add Web Application Firewall (WAF) protection
3. Implement zero-trust network architecture
4. Add behavioral analysis for anomaly detection

## Compliance Considerations

### Standards Alignment
- **CIS Kubernetes Benchmark**: Following CIS security recommendations
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Aligned with NIST guidelines
- **OWASP Top 10**: Addressing common web application vulnerabilities
- **SOC 2**: Preparing for SOC 2 compliance requirements

### Documentation Requirements
- Security architecture documentation
- Incident response procedures
- Data handling and privacy policies
- Vendor security assessments
