# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive frontend admin UI for the Dyad CLI Gateway system. The admin UI will provide operators with a web-based interface to manage AI providers, configure model mappings, monitor system health, manage API keys, and test provider integrations. The frontend will integrate with the existing backend admin endpoints and follow modern React/TypeScript development practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a gateway administrator, I want to view and manage all registered AI providers in a centralized dashboard, so that I can efficiently oversee the system's provider configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to the providers list page THEN the system SHALL display all registered providers with their status, type, and basic information
2. WHEN I view a provider in the list THEN the system SHALL show provider name, type (spawn-cli/http-sdk/proxy/local), enabled/disabled status, and last health check timestamp
3. WHEN I click on a provider THEN the system SHALL navigate to the detailed provider view
4. WHEN I use quick actions on a provider THEN the system SHALL allow me to enable/disable, edit, delete, or test the provider
5. IF no providers exist THEN the system SHALL display an empty state with a call-to-action to create the first provider

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a gateway administrator, I want to create and configure new AI providers through a guided form interface, so that I can easily add new AI services to the gateway.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "Create Provider" THEN the system SHALL display a multi-step form for provider configuration
2. WHEN I select a provider type THEN the system SHALL dynamically show relevant configuration fields for that adapter type

5. WHEN I configure a proxy provider THEN the system SHALL require proxy base URL and API key header configuration
6. WHEN I configure a local provider THEN the system SHALL require local endpoint and model configuration
7. WHEN I submit the form THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields and create the provider
8. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages for each invalid field
9. WHEN provider creation succeeds THEN the system SHALL navigate to the provider detail page

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a gateway administrator, I want to edit existing provider configurations and model mappings, so that I can maintain and update provider settings as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the edit provider page THEN the system SHALL pre-populate the form with current provider configuration
2. WHEN I modify provider settings THEN the system SHALL validate changes in real-time
3. WHEN I edit model mappings THEN the system SHALL allow me to add, remove, and modify dyad-to-adapter model mappings
4. WHEN I add a model mapping THEN the system SHALL require both dyadModelId and adapterModelId fields
5. WHEN I save changes THEN the system SHALL update the provider configuration and refresh the provider list
6. IF I have unsaved changes and navigate away THEN the system SHALL prompt me to confirm losing changes
7. WHEN I cancel editing THEN the system SHALL revert to the original configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a gateway administrator, I want to test provider configurations to ensure they work correctly, so that I can verify connectivity and functionality before enabling them for production use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "Test Provider" THEN the system SHALL open a test dialog with sample request configuration
2. WHEN I configure a test request THEN the system SHALL allow me to specify model, messages, and other parameters
3. WHEN I run a test THEN the system SHALL send a request to the provider and display the response
4. WHEN a test succeeds THEN the system SHALL show the response data, latency, and success status
5. WHEN a test fails THEN the system SHALL display error details, logs, and troubleshooting information
6. WHEN I view test results THEN the system SHALL show request/response details in a readable format
7. WHEN I run multiple tests THEN the system SHALL maintain a history of recent test results

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a gateway administrator, I want to monitor provider health and system metrics in real-time, so that I can quickly identify and respond to issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the monitoring dashboard THEN the system SHALL display real-time health status for all providers
2. WHEN I view system metrics THEN the system SHALL show request counts, error rates, and response times
3. WHEN a provider becomes unhealthy THEN the system SHALL highlight the provider with warning indicators
4. WHEN I view provider details THEN the system SHALL show historical performance data and recent logs
5. WHEN I access the logs viewer THEN the system SHALL display recent provider test logs and system events
6. IF real-time updates are available THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh metrics without page reload
7. WHEN I filter metrics by time range THEN the system SHALL update charts and statistics accordingly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a gateway administrator, I want to manage API keys and access controls, so that I can secure the gateway and control client access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access API key management THEN the system SHALL display all existing API keys with their status and permissions
2. WHEN I create a new API key THEN the system SHALL generate a secure key and display it once for copying
3. WHEN I configure API key permissions THEN the system SHALL allow me to set provider access and rate limits
4. WHEN I revoke an API key THEN the system SHALL immediately disable access and update the key status
5. WHEN I view API key usage THEN the system SHALL show request statistics and usage patterns
6. IF an API key is compromised THEN the system SHALL allow immediate revocation and regeneration
7. WHEN I audit API key activity THEN the system SHALL provide logs of key usage and administrative actions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a gateway administrator, I want to use a chat playground interface to test different models and configurations interactively, so that I can validate provider responses and debug issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the chat playground THEN the system SHALL provide an interactive chat interface
2. WHEN I select a model THEN the system SHALL populate available models from configured providers
3. WHEN I send a message THEN the system SHALL display the request/response in a conversational format
4. WHEN I inspect requests THEN the system SHALL show raw request/response data with formatting
5. WHEN I save conversations THEN the system SHALL maintain a history of chat sessions
6. WHEN I use prompt templates THEN the system SHALL provide pre-configured prompts for testing

4. WHEN I view content with high contrast needs THEN the system SHALL meet WCAG accessibility guidelines
5. WHEN I access forms THEN the system SHALL provide clear labels, error messages, and validation feedback
